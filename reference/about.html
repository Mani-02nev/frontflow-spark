               <h2>History of SIT</h2>
               <div class="scroll-box">
                    <p>
                         Thiru V. Seshasayee was born in the year 1890 in the village of Valadi, a suburb of
                         Thiruchirappalli. He came from a middle-class family of modest means.V. Seshasayee studied in
                         St. Joseph’s High School until he matriculated from there. Impressed by the intelligence and
                         technical acumen of Thiru V. Seshasayee, Mr. Winter, Chief Electrical and Signal Engineer of
                         the South Indian Railway, recruited him as an apprentice, which gave Thiru V. Seshasayee an
                         opportunity to learn many new things. In fact, he helped Mr. Winter to devise the ‘Block
                         System’ which has been used by the Railways ever since. Thiru V. Seshasayee and Thiru R.
                         Seshasayee, with a couple of friends, set up a small engineering workshop called “The
                         Seshasayee Brothers Engineering Works” and repaired oil engines, automobiles, generator set
                         installations, etc. They made a mark especially by rectifying and commissioning an electrical
                         generator set, battery, and an ice-making plant in the palace of Raja Dinakar, followed by
                         temple lighting at Rameshwaram, Madurai, and in the houses of rich Nagarathars of Devakottai,
                         Karaikudi, and Kanadukathan. The firm also developed the first passenger vehicle with Mr.
                         Carter of Addison & Company. A public limited company was formed under the name and style of
                         ‘The Tiruchy Srirangam Electric Supply Corporation Limited’ and almost simultaneously a similar
                         company in Devakottai by the name ‘Sri Meenakshi Sundareshwarar Electric Supply Corporation
                         Limited’ to distribute D.C. They established the first A.C. supply system in the state in
                         Devakottai in 1927 and Tiruchirappalli in 1928. By 1934, the Tiruchirappalli power station had
                         become the biggest diesel power station then in South India, and a number of diesel power
                         stations sprang up in various cities. Thiru V. Seshasayee saw the wisdom of hydro power schemes
                         as the ultimate solution for the state’s rapidly increasing power needs and engaged in
                         hydroelectric power generation utilizing the waters of Pykara in Nilgiris so that a statewide
                         grid could be set up and hydro power distributed to all the cities rather than the costlier oil
                         power. Thiru V. Seshasayee’s enterprise, vision, foresight, and continuous cooperation with the
                         government were primarily responsible for the robust electricity supply system we have today.
                         Thiru V. Seshasayee successfully commissioned a small caustic soda plant, the first of its type
                         in India, at Mettur Dam known as Mettur Chemicals, for which the then Madras Government had
                         offered special attractive power tariffs. Today, this factory is one of India’s leading
                         producers of basic chemicals like caustic soda, bleaching powder, liquid chlorine, and other
                         related products. Thiru V. Seshasayee assisted in commissioning a 50,000-ton sulphate plant in
                         Travancore using electrolytic processes and also diversified the end products to urea and
                         ammonium nitrate. Thiru V. Seshasayee actively promoted the exploitation of gypsum mining in
                         Trichy district and assisted in establishing salt manufacture in Athirampathinam and
                         Vedharanyam. He formed “Seshasayee Industries Limited” and established a 1200-ton high
                         insulator factory with an associated forging shop and a foundry at Neyveli in South Arcot
                         District, and around 5000 people were employed in these industries directly. As an outcome of
                         his enterprise, the South Indian public, essentially interested in agriculture, grew
                         industrial-minded and started lending support to entrepreneurs who followed in his way. South
                         India has been fairly well drawn in the industrial map of India. Thiru V. Seshasayee was an
                         active member of the co-operative movement. He formed a building co-operative society nearly 50
                         years ago in Tiruchirappalli, which built houses worth over rupees 30 lakh for middle-class
                         people. As its director since inception, and president from 1939 to 1958, he encouraged his
                         staff to form small co-operatives for their various needs like provision shops, credit and loan
                         societies, etc. Thiru V. Seshasayee was unostentatious, business-like, and friendly to all with
                         a keen sense of justice and fair play. He looked to his responsibilities as a businessman very
                         seriously without any compromise. He died on 19th October, 1958.
